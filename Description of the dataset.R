Description of the dataset (dimensions, content of each of the variables).
1. Describe the dataset (focusing on the dataset for 2014)
2. Describe GRI & SHI including the basic deriviation process and simply instruct the questions used for the calculation of these two indices
3. Describe other datasets would be used to do linear regression with GRI & SHI: education level, GDP level, etc. 

Descriptive statistics (univariate descriptive statistics and bivariate).
1. Characteristics of each question (eg. Would the education level be affected by the GRI? Would the GDP have certain relationship with GRI & SHI?)

Correlation analyses
1. Coorelation of GRI & SHI (for all countries, for countries in the same area)
2. Variance of GRI & SHI (for all countries, for countries in the same area)

Regression
1. Linear relationship between the GRI & SHI & all other factors on the supplymentary datasets
